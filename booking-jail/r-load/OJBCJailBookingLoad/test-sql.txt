# SQL statements to put additional test data in staging

## The following test the scenario where we get a CustodyRelease before we get its booking

# Run these two statements first...
insert into CustodyRelease (BookingNumber, ReleaseDate, ReleaseTime) values ('B9999999', '2016-10-23', '05:55:55');
select last_insert_id() into @PendingCustodyReleaseID;

# Now run a dimensional load.  You should not see the above CustodyRelease record added to the dimensional db.

# Then run the next three statements, followed by another dimensional load.  The Person, Booking and CustodyRelease records should get added

insert into Person (PersonUniqueIdentifier) values ('P9999999');
insert into Booking (BookingNumber, PersonID, BookingDate) values ('B9999999', last_insert_id(), '2016-10-10');
update CustodyRelease set BookingID=last_insert_id(), CustodyReleaseTimestamp=current_timestamp() where CustodyReleaseID=@PendingCustodyReleaseID;

## END Scenario
