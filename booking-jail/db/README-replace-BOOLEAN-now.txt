To create a MS SQLServer database from the OJBDimensionalModel script generated by
SQL PA, we need to search-and-replace BOOLEAN types with BIT types and now() with getdate().  
The following sed commands does it:

(assumes analyticsDB-sqlserver.sql is the script generated by SQL PA, the same file will be modified as the output)

sed -i -e 's/BOOLEAN/BIT/g' analyticsDB-sqlserver.sql
sed -i -e 's/now()/getdate()/g' analyticsDB-sqlserver.sql
