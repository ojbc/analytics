SQL Power Architect does not properly capture the MySQL TIMESTAMP type.  Thus to create a database from the OJBDimensionalModel script generated by
SQL PA, you need to search-and-replace some DATETIME types with TIMESTAMP types.  The following sed one-liner does it:

(assumes ojbc_analytics.sql is the script generated by SQL PA and ojbc_analytics-clean.sql is the cleaned-up script)

sed s/Timestamp\ DATETIME/Timestamp\ TIMESTAMP/g < ojbc_analytics.sql > ojbc_analytics-clean.sql
